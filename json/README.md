## ðŸ“„ Additional Info

Make sure the `.json` file is named after the **character** (or "Resonator") â€” for example:
`ciaccona.json` instead of `1607.json`.

### Why is this important?

When you run the program, it will ask you to enter the character name. This name is then used to generate meaningful filenames for the audio files. Naming the JSON after the character ensures everything lines up and stays human-readable â€” much better than dealing with numeric IDs!

## ðŸ§¾ Expected JSON Structure

Hereâ€™s a simplified look at the structure your `.json` file should follow:

```json
{
    // ...
    "Words": [
        {
            "Id": 140701,
            "RoleId": 1407,
            "Type": 1,
            "Sort": 1,
            "Title": "Thoughts: I",
            "Content": "Some dialogue text here...",
            "Voice": "/Game/ExamplePath/play_example.play_example",
            "VoiceEn": "https://api.encore.moe/resource/ExamplePath/en/example.mp3",
            "VoiceJa": "https://api.encore.moe/resource/ExamplePath/ja/example.mp3",
            "VoiceKo": "https://api.encore.moe/resource/ExamplePath/ko/example.mp3",
            "VoiceZh": "https://api.encore.moe/resource/ExamplePath/zh/example.mp3"
        }
    ]
    // ...
}
```

### ðŸŽ¯ What This Program Actually Uses

From the full JSON, the downloader only uses these specific fields:

* `Title` â€” Used for naming and reference
* `VoiceEn` â€” English voice line URL
* `VoiceJa` â€” Japanese voice line URL
* `VoiceKo` â€” Korean voice line URL
* `VoiceZh` â€” Chinese voice line URL
