# ðŸ§¾ Expected JSON Structure

Hereâ€™s a simplified look at the structure your `.json` file should follow:

```json
{
    // ...
    "Words": [
        {
            "Id": 140701,
            "RoleId": 1407,
            "Type": 1,
            "Sort": 1,
            "Title": "Thoughts: I",
            "Content": "Some dialogue text here...",
            "Voice": "/Game/ExamplePath/play_example.play_example",
            "VoiceEn": "https://api.encore.moe/resource/ExamplePath/en/example.mp3",
            "VoiceJa": "https://api.encore.moe/resource/ExamplePath/ja/example.mp3",
            "VoiceKo": "https://api.encore.moe/resource/ExamplePath/ko/example.mp3",
            "VoiceZh": "https://api.encore.moe/resource/ExamplePath/zh/example.mp3"
        }
    ]
    // ...
}
```
